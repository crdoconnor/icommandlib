{{{{ intro.txt }}}}

Icommandlib is an interactive command line runner, designed (unlike pexpect) to be able to run command line applications in a virtual terminal window and take screenshots.

It was designed for building self rewriting, documentation generating tests [like this](https://github.com/hitchdev/hitchstory/tree/master/examples/commandline)
for interactive command line apps with the [hitchstory framework](/hitchstory).

ICommandLib can take both terminal text screenshots and "stripshots" - terminal screenshots with all the white space to the right and bottom of the screen stripped.
