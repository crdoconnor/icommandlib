# ICommandLib

The interactive command library.

ICommandLib is a pythonic tool for running UNIX processes in a virtual terminal
and interacting with them. It's a bit like pexpect.

It depends upon [CommandLib](https://hitchdev.com/commandlib), which is necessary for defining the commands which you want to run.

To install:

```sh
$ pip install icommandlib
```
